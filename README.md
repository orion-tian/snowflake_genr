# snowflake_genr

Maya tool for making simple snowflakes, specifically ones resembling dendrite 
and plate snowflakes. They are simple snowflakes since they have no iterative 
properties such as sub-branches upon sub-branches or secondary details on top 
of the branches. 

For dendrites, users can control the number of main branches along with how many sub-branches each main branch has. For each sub-branch, they can also specify its 
position along the main branch, its length, and its angle. 

For plates, users similar control number of main branches and how many hexagon 
plates each main branch has. For each hexagon, they can specify its position, its
radius, and its length.
